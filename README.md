# React-Color-Picker

<p>
  Hi Fellas! I am back again with a new project a very beginner level but to clear the concepts of react. In this project, you can generate random colors and also can copy the hexcode of your favourite color.
  For styling, I have used Bootstrap, and Animate.css for rubber animation whenever you hit the copy button, you will see a beautiful animation on the hexcode
